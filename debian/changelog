python-django (0.95-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Piotr Ozarowski ]
  * Added XS-Vcs-Svn field

  [ Brett Parker ]
  * Made manage.py get a shebang with the version of python
    used when running django-admin (closes: #401616)
  * Moved bin to /usr/lib/python-django/bin and added a symlink
    from python-support/python-django/django/bin to it
  * Changed shebangs on the bin scripts to use the default version
    of python (i.e. /usr/bin/python)
